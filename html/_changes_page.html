<h1><a class="anchor" name="_changes_page">Changes</a></h1><hr>
<p>
The following updates were introduced as part of work undertaken as an employee of Newport Networks. (<a href="http://www.newport-networks.com">http://www.newport-networks.com</a>)<p>
Graeme McKerrell<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_7_3">
0.7.3</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>minor bug fix from Cliff Martin which avoids a SEGV when CTRL-C is invoked on an empty line.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_7_2">
0.7.2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>updated the default value fix slightly to ensure that if the default is set to the empty string then the parameter will not be translated. This means that legacy code which uses an empty default as an indicator of a parameter not being provided will continue to work.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>incorporated bug from Charlie (nmsguru at sourceforge dot net) to make sure that default values are correctly translated. e.g. a SELECT parameter can be given the textual name in the XML and will be translated into the appropriate interpretation when used.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated the configuration so that the --enable-lubheap option is disabled by default. There were a number of people which were having problems compiling the memory management code and tests.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added in lub_partition component which provides a fast local memory heap for the current thread as well as a global mutex controlled heap which is used by multiple threads.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added statistics to lub_blockpool component</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>performance overhaul of lub_heap component. Added a cache for smaller sized blocks which provides a boost to the alocation/deallocation speed.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated escape_decode() function in vt100.c to become non-blocking for the scope of decoding an escape sequence. This prevents hanging the input if a user presses the ESC key.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added a lub_heap_show_allocs() function which enables any leak detection tracked allocations to be output. This is useful in the case where memory corruption is preventing a scan from taking place.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated <a class="el" href="group__lub__heap.html#g5d43fb90d77f185f6cb9d012ae5074a5">lub_heap__set_framecount()</a> so that when you disable leak detection the tainting state is returned to that before leak detection was enabled.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>implemented correct alignement allocations of sizes other than native alignment. Changed the naming convention to LUB_HEAP_ALIGN_2_POWER_X and provided support upto 128MB alignment.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated the memInit() function in lubheap/vxwork/memLib.c to call memLibInit() and memPartLibInit(). This is necessary for systems which only call memInit() in usrRoot() routine.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated the root-view.xml example file to demonstrate the use of different parameter types.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated the named-view.xml example file to demonstrate the use of viewid.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added patch from Anselmo Lacerda Silveira de Melo to add CTRL-U key combination to tinyrl which deletes the current line contents.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed "const-ness" issue in lub/heap/context.c</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added error checking to posix/heap_leak_mutex.c in case the pthread calls fail.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added heap address to the details output by <a class="el" href="group__lub__heap.html#g9d0e743dc5ea4c92d5ad46a337b9bb29">lub_heap_show()</a></li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed possible uninitialised variable in heap_realloc.c</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated clish.xsd to make sure the "PARAM" tag is named.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_7_1">
0.7.1</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Cleaned up configure.ac, added --enable-lubheap experimental option which can be used to replace the normal system memory libraries with a lub/heap implementation. Added librt and libintl support as well as POSIXifiying the build for clean building under LINUX.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the shell_spawn.c file to enable tilde expansion in CLISH_PATH.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>split lub_heap platform specifics into two parts 1) the platform specific support code required by the core lub_heap implementation. 2) a lubheap component which can be linked in to replace the normal platform memory libraries.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated lub_heap component so that memory scanning is handled by specific functions rather than assume the naming conventions of particular sections during the link. The platform specific code now has to perform the scanning.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>refactored lub/heap/vxworks to better override vxworks libraries when linked in as a library.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed lub_heap component so that it compiles on 64 bit architecture, and with GCC-4.0</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated tinyxml to version 2.5.1</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated lub/heap/vxworks/malloc.c/free.c/realloc.c to undefine any MACRO set with their function name. This ensures that they always get compiled with the correct name, even if the rest of the CLISH framework is being compiled to use an alternative memory heap, via -D options</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue in tinyrl_readline where raw mode was enabled (and input buffer flushed) between printing prompt and accepting input. This was causing things like expect scripts to fail. Fix was to change to raw mode prior to printing the prompt.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed lub_heap component to work with latest version of Cygwin. The areas which use the __builtin_return_address() function, provided by GCC, now uses the lub_heap_data_start value to check whether a returned address is beyond the "text" section. Hence a stack trace is deemed to come to an end if either the return address is 0 or greater than lub_heap_data_start.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Changed next pointer in lub_heap_s to be "lub_heap_s *"as opposed to "lub_heap_t *" so that GDB does not give incomplete type.</li></ul>
<p>
Fixed memory stomp in tinyrl_completion.<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to account for obscure problem related to C-strings being signed and the <a class="el" href="ctype_8h-source.html">ctype.h</a> API taking a signed integer.</li></ul>
<p>
If a string contains characters greater than 127 then the signed bit will be set and when calling a <a class="el" href="ctype_8h-source.html">ctype.h</a> utility this can get sign extended. e.g. char *ptr = "£10"; isspace(*ptr); will have the value -100 passed to the function (or MACRO) as the '£' character (decimal 156) is negative when held as a signed char.<p>
The solution is to ensure that you always used unsigned chars to pass to the utility functions. This was achieved by adding a lub_ctype component which provides 8-bit safe versions of these functions.<p>
<ul>
<li>added ability to have scripts stop on error or not by introducing a new clish_source_no_stop entry point,</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added ability to limit the maximum line length in tinyrl.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in tinyrl_completion which was stomping on memory when there were an exact multiple of 10 completions. Fix is to allocate one extra entry for the NULL terminator.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added <a class="el" href="group__lub__heap.html#g17abaa12fe023d24618ca9cff747f009">lub_heap_destroy()</a> operation which frees up a heap object so that the memory segments used for it can be reused for something else.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated lub_heap so that leak scanning will account for any non-monitored allocated blocks in the system. This prevents false leaks from being reported. However it cannot account for any of the non-monitored blocks being leaked themselves.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>stripped out some spurious code in vxworks/heap_symShow.c</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>lubMallocTest.exe now exercises stress test on lub_heap component. mallocTest.exe runs the same test on the native heap manager for the host platform.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed <a class="el" href="group__lub__heap.html#g39480d0aba862821dde07cfcc1fd8ed3">lub_heap__get_max_free()</a> to work when no free blocks are present.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added a generic lub_heap_scan_stack() function which can be used to scan any variables held in the current stack up to 32 levels. (needed for non VxWorks systems)</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>made lub_heap_scan_memory() take a const void* argument.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated <a class="el" href="heap_8h-source.html">lub/heap.h</a> to work when included from C++ file.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated the posix/heap_symShow.c to use libbfd for symbol decoding. A <a class="el" href="group__lub__heap.html#g93612fe6821dedb10b7347f6a6b78193">lub_heap_init()</a> operation now exists which is called to provide the filename of the current program so that symbols can be loaded.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>disabled memory leak detection and memory taiting by default for the POSIX platform.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>changed default behaviour to tainting and leak detection off.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>when leak detection is enabled for the first time an exit handler is registered to dump memory when a program completes.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated configure.ac so that -disable-gpl may be used to prevent linking with GPL licenced libraries.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in tinyrl_completion which was stomping on memory when there were an exact multiple of 10 completions. Fix is to allocate one extra entry for the NULL terminator.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in clish_pargv_new() which was only allocating enough memory for the number of arguments entered on the command-line. In the case of optional trailing parameters, which were not entered, this caused a memory stomp! Fixed by allocating enough memory for the maximum of the entered parameters or the command parameters.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added clish_command__get_param_count() method to obtain the number of parameters associated with a command.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in lub_heap_graft_to_bottom; the tail was not getting it's free and segment fields set up.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_7_0">
0.7.0</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated shell_execute.c to ensure that directories are not executed</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed minor bug in autocompletion of parameters. clish_shell_parameter_generator() needed to account for trailing space when giving context sensitive help for parameters.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated lub_heap to maintain the length of blocks inclusive of the block headers and tail. This reduces the overhead of manipulating sizes during operations and also addresses an issue with the re-use of previously freed blocks.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added dblockpool component for creating dynamic chunks to be used as blockpools. The lub_heap implementation now uses this for holding context instances, which both reduces the overhead memory used and greatly reduces fragmentation when detecting leaks.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed double insert bug in the lub_bintree_insert.c file. Although the function was correctly returning -1 it was also replacing the root node with the provided client node!</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated shell_tinyrl.c so that typing "?" whilst in the middle of a quoted string inserts the '?' character rather than giving context sensitive help.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed memory leaks which occurred when clish thread is cancelled during execution of a script.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated to make the execution of a script asynchronously cancellable.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>modified clish_shell's history command to use new methods</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added tinyrl_history_entry__get_index() method and removed tinyrl_history__get_base()</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>modified tinyrl_history so that index is held in the history_entry instances Then updated the history insertion code so that duplicate entries are only held once in the history. This means that numeric gaps can now occur in the history list, but a stifled list will no longer force recent commands off the list through the repetition of a single command.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated tinyrl_completion() so that if the completion list contains words which have a common (case insensitive) prefix are correctly handled. Before this fix if commands "one" and "OneTwoThree" both existed in the same view then the user would be unable to type anything beyond "one".</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug in clish_shell_tinyrl_key_enter() where a pointer to the line for the current tinyrl instance was being held onto after it had been changed by an auto-completion, hence was now referencing freed memory.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that when reading a script and an error occurs we don't bother to show the errored command line after the "DING"</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that after reading a script the prompt isn't duplicated.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed memory leak in clish_pargv_init() where the 'args' parameter wasn't releasing its working string.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed tinyrl_redisplay so that CTRL-K works; wasn't accounting for insertion point movements before erasing characters from end of line.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed history.c so that stifled history lists add_n_replace() properly. This also addresses an assertion which was occuring with "history 1"</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated clish_shell class so that when an error occurs in a script, execution is terminated in any parent scripts. This doesn't terminate an interactive session. This means that a script will now only run until it's first error (or the first error of a child script etc...)</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>plugged a poential memory leak in <a class="el" href="group__lub__string.html#g0220074bffb726c7858444c1eac7619f">lub_string_catn()</a> function.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed clish_shell_delete() so that the file stack is cleared out.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated lub/argv class to be more resilient when memory allocation failures occur.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>reduced the terminal noise generated by tinyrl when auto-completion occurs.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>reduced the termnal noise generated by tinyrl when user deletes characters from the end of a line.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>VxWorks has an issue with its pthreads library which means that a cleanup hook can be called multiple times (recursively)!!!. Updated the cleanup function to set the pthread cancel state to PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE to prevent this.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>found and fixed a memory leak in the stack of files being used for input.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated auto-completion code to handle quoted arguments.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed echoing issue when echoing should be hidden.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>overhauled the auto-completion code. Now capable of autocompleting parameters as well as commands. Parameters are now validated as they are typed. This has involved some restructuring of the tinyrl_completion interfaces.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed so that validation of integers works correctly.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>removing the spurious auto-completions has had the side effect of not echoing commands executed from scripts. fixed this issue.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>modified the help system so that if a command has possible other commands which are an extension of the current command name (e.g. slot, slotOne, slotTwo) then the command help will be augmented the summary help of the possile completion commands.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug where the SPACE key could cause spurious completion information to be displayed before entering a space character.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed clish_shell_help.c so that any detailed help held for "place-holder" commands (e.g. "show slot" has a place holder command called "show") will be displayed when ?? is entered.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed bug where entering a command which happened to be a prefix of other commands, caused spurious completion information to be displayed before executing the command.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>cleaned up the tinyrl.c to remove a spurious tinyrl_crlf() call when reading a line. If a command outputs no text to stdout/stderr then the prompt will now reappear on the following line rather than leave a blank.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the context sensitive help so that any parmeters which have specific ranges e.g. "integer" or "selection" indicate these possible values in the help text.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the ptype class to allow for pre-processing of parameter before validation. See the XML schema for details.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the ptype class to allow three methods for parameter validation. "regexp"[default], "integer" and "select" See the XML schema for details.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Went through the code cleaning up PC Lint issues.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Added a last_buffer field to the tinyrl class to cache the last displayed line. This can then be used to reduce the number of output characters when only a single char has been added to the end. This simplifies the automated testing/interaction with the CLI. e.g. expect scripts.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated tinyrl.c to cache the isatty settings. This provides a new operation called tinyrl__get_isatty()</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>removed nested shell support for a single client. It is no longer needed as the "clish_source" command is used instead of spawning another shell.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>changed so that history entries are only added for interactive lines. So if for example a user were to "clish_source" another file, the commands so issued from that file will not be added to the history.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>changed "clish_spawn" back to "clish_source" and implemented a stack of file handles per shell instance. The spawning of a sub-script was resource intensive, and had issues with spawned pthreads not having the attributes (e.g. stack size) as the parent thread. It also felt too clunky to have multiple shell associated with a single client.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed tinyrl_readline() to make sure that lines longer than 80 chars are handled correctly when read from a script.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>modified tinyrl_replace_line() to only modify the insertion point if the buffer shrinks beyond the current insertion point. This addresses the inserting spaces in the middle of a line issue.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed clish_shell_spawn_from_file() so that it returns BOOL_TRUE upon success.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed tclish executable to read input from files correctly.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated tinyrl.c to simply read non-tty input streams rather than try and treat them like an interactive session.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed tclish executable to account for nested shells being attached to a single client. (using the "clish_spawn" builtin command.) Only when the root shell is initialised or finalised will the resources be allocated and freed.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>renamed the "clish_source" builtin command to "clish_spawn"; it takes a filename and spawns a new shell to interpret the contents of the file.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>added tinyrl__get_istream() tinyrl__get_ostream(), tinyrl_vt100__get_istream() and tinyrl_vt100__get_ostream() operations. This means that a client of CLISH can identify which file handles are being used. This is useful in the case of a client which is sourcing files using the "clish_source" builtin command.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed to ensure that SPACE auto-completion works with commands which take "args" type parameters.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_3">
0.6.3</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated tinyrl.c to ensure that SPACE auto-completes multi-word commands.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated tinyrl.c to ensure that the line is redisplayed after a completion has been performed. This is needed to ensure that when a line is complete e.g. when pressing ENTER, the completion is shown before moving on.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed a freed memory usage in clish/shell/shell_tinyrl.c where a line pointer was obtained before completion was performed, then used. Needed to re-aquire the line pointer after completion, because it could have changed.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed a memory corruption in tinyrl/history.c where a spurious NULL terminator was being added to the vector of history entries and corrupting the heap.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated command help to show the full multi-word command in the detailed help. Also shows required parameters &lt;like_this&gt;</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_2">
0.6.2</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>removed any non-interpreter specific setup/restore details from tclish_init_callback and tclishell_fini_callback and put them into tclish.cpp</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated tinyrl_readline() to change the terminal input mode on the fly to raw mode and then restore it when the line has been entered. This is needed to ensure that the terminal is in the correct mode for any sub-shells which are launched. This means that clish_init_callback.c and clish_fini_callback.c are redundant so have been removed.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated clish_shell_spawn interface to take a pthread attibute as a parameter this makes it possible for a client to control the thread details.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation cleanups; added link to sourceforge pages, removed redundant issues, started a doxygen todo list.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_1">
0.6.1</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where trying to insert text in the middle of a line caused the remains of the line to be deleted.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>updated the tdemo script to use the normal installation location for TCL /usr/share/tcl8.4 rather than /usr/local/share/tcl8.4 which is used when you build it from scratch.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_0">
0.6.0</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_0e">
0.6.0e</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed shell_spawn.c so that client initialisation can fail hence cause the creation of the shell instance to be terminated. This means that client's may choose to perform user authentication at this point if they so wish.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Added a cmd_line hook which is called to provide the client details of each command line accepted by the shell. This enables logging of this detail if so required.</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_0d">
0.6.0d</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>updated the autoconf system to use the TCL version for the tclishX.X name.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>fixed clish/tclish_init_callback.c so that Tcl_FindExecutable() is called. This is required to setup the TCL environment correctly. 0.6.0c release didn't load init.tcl correctly and was also crashing when file operations were performed (e.g. glob, pwd)</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>finalized clish.xsd with proper namespace details</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="_0_6_0c">
0.6.0c</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed autoconf scripts to check for pthreads and TCL library.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated lub_argv class to be able to tell you when a parameter was quoted. The paramter value itself will not contain the " marks.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced "args" and "args_help" attributes to the COMMAND element. This enables the remenant of a command line, after the parameters defined in the PARAMS elements, to be assigned to a psuedo parameter variable.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a "escape_chars" attribute to the COMMAND element. This allows commands to override the default selection of characters which are escaped (e.g. $) when expanded from a variable. Escaping of special characters is a security feature to prevent the user from executing an underlying shell command through the use of "clever" parameters. e.g. "fred`rm -rf \*`bloggs" would be a rather unfortunate parameter on a UNIX system!!!</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a "builtin" attribute to the ACTION element. Also enabled clients to register their own built commands when spawning a shell. The XML MUST now specify a builtin attribute to invoke a builtin command callback.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>entering an empty line simply redisplays the prompt. This enables a user to create some clear space on the screen.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Added tinyxml into the distibution; currently the tarball of this component (available from <a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/index.html">http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/index.html</a>) doesn't support autoconf, so by adding this in (plus a module.am) you get autoconf support. This library is 'much' smaller than libxml2 and hence is more appropriate for an embedded system. libxml2 is no longer needed by clish.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Added spawn interface to the shell class. This causes a separate thread to be lauched to handle the shell session. This is required for flat namespace embedded envrioments where you may need to sustain multiple concurrent sessions.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced tinyrl component. This is a simplistic replacement for the readline library, which cannot be used in embedded-single memory space systems due to the use of global variables. Tinyrl implements sufficient functionality for the clish component to function, and no-more although more may be added in the future. readline is no longer needed to build clish.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated clish component so that "viewid" tag can be used to define view specific variables. The syntax is of the form "fred=hello world;bert=goodbye" and causes ${fred} and ${bert} to expand to the assigned values whilst in the new view. NB. the values themselves may be based on variables available in the current context (e.g. environment, parameters or current viewid variables.)</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated clish component to use history escape sequences via an external history_expand function. tinyrl_history currently supports "!!" "!N" and "!-N" expansion.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated clish component to not use the exit(1) command to terminate the shell instead a "close" instruction can be given to the shell and it will exit it's external loop and terminate normally. This is for ease of use in single-memory-space embedded systems.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Added a partial string test, which confirmed a bug in the VxWorks standard headers which was causing lub_string_nocase_cmp() to work incorrectly.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated clish component to support STARTUP XML element. This is used to display a banner and perform a startup action when a shell is first started.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated clish component to support OVERVIEW XML element. This is used to display some textual help when the clish_overview internal command is specified in an ACTION element.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Updated clish component to support the DETAILS XML element. These enhance the context sensitive help with the ability to provide more details for a particular command. (a repeated press of the '?' key displays this extra detail)</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Introduces more built in commands (can be specified in the ACTION element) There are now four in total. "clish_close" - terminates the session. "clish_overview" - displays the text defined in the OVERVIEW element of the XML. "clish_history [n]" - displays the currently held history of command lines. Also enables the stifling of the history list to a value specified by the optional parameter 'n'. A value of zero means unstifled. "clish_source file" - spawn a separate clish session reading the input from the specified file. Output still goes to the current output stream.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Mapped [space] and [enter] to auto-complete commands if appropriate.</li></ul>
